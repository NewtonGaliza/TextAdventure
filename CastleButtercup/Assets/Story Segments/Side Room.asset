  storyText: "Side Room\r\n\r\nYou enter the room to find 15 of King Buttercup\u2019s
    servants wearing nothing but their skivvies engaged in a ferocious food fight. 
    Food is flying everywhere! \r\n\r\nUpon your entrance, the food fight comes to
    a screeching halt and all of the servants turn to stare at you. \r\n\r\nThis
    is awkward. \r\n\r\nYou make your excuses and slowly back out of the room closing
    the door quietly behind you. You can hear the sounds of the food fight continuing
    on the other side of the closed door.\r\n\r\nWow!.......Just.......Wow!\r\n\r\nDid
    they say \u201Cwow!\u201D in medieval times? Moving on.\r\n\r\nPress 1 to return
    to the grand entrance"
